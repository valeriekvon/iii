             Introduction: Mapping the Structure of the Report

My critical report investigates how principles of softer computing can challenge dominant graphic design paradigms within digital environments. Through intertwining personal experience, critical theory, and practical design experimentation, my work offers a reflective and critical approach to design practice. The structure mirrors my methodology, which begins with personal observations and analysis and then transitions to practical application and outcomes.
The first chapter reflects on early personal interactions with digital culture, contrasting the remnants of a participatory web with today's commercialised, algorithmically driven digital landscape. To shape my contextual understanding, I drew insights from theorists such as William Powers, Hito Steyerl, and Marshall McLuhan. This section describes the shift from an intimate, open digital space to one dominated by corporate platforms and algorithmic control.
The second chapter introduces softer computing as a critical and creative response to these shifts. Exploring values like friction, transparency, care, and slowness, I question dominant design tools, particularly software defaults exemplified by Adobe Creative Suite, that restrict experimentation and diminish designer agency. This critique lays the groundwork for imagining and articulating alternatives through a values-driven manifesto informed by philosophers and theorists, including Ursula Franklin and Ursula K. Le Guin.
In the third chapter, I demonstrate the practical application of softer computing through tool-making, particularly in the field of typography. Typography serves as a site to test these concepts due to its historical entanglement with Eurocentric, modernist, and capitalist ideologies. My design outcomes include a modular type design tool, a publication platform, and an open-source resource list, each embodying and extending the principles of softer computing into practical, participatory forms. My outcomes are designed with attention to creative process, for sharing, questioning, and reimagining the future of design without reliance on capitalist-driven default systems.

          Personal Reflections: The Early Web and Shift to Commercialised Web

Though I did not directly experience the earliest era of the internet, I came of age in its immediate afterlife. By the time I was old enough to explore the web on my own in the late 2000s and early 2010s, much of the so-called free web of the 1990s had already faded, but remnants lingered. I remember the first time I loaded a webpage on a tiny Nokia screen around 2009: glitchy, barely legible, and slow, yet still magical in its promise. Although I arrived after the golden age of dial-up and GeoCities, I caught glimpses of it in fragments of hand-coded personal pages, small forums, and clunky web design that hinted at a more open and DIY digital past.
These small fleeting fragments shaped how I understood the internet. They suggested that technology could be personal, open-ended, and shaped by lived experience. I began to wonder: what changed? And more urgently, what was lost? Marshall McLuhan’s idea of the “global village” (1964) still resonates today, when early technologies, though awkward and limited, fostered a genuine sense of connection. As Chayka (2014) observes in his meditation on Web 1.0, this period was marked by a quieter, safer, and more personal internet. The prevailing dream was that digital space might be a place for self-authorship, a hope that now feels distant. 
Looking back, the amateur web of the mid-1990s, what Olia Lialina (2015) calls the vernacular web, offers a powerful contrast to the highly centralised, commercialised digital spaces of today. This earlier web was personal, messy, often unpolished, and almost always “under construction.” It was shaped by its users. Internet users build pages out of curiosity, care, or self-expression without the pressure of metrics, branding, or optimization. In this context, the act of publishing online was intimate and autonomous. Every page was an experiment, a hand-coded reflection of its maker’s intent, and often a product of learning through making.
Lialina’s term “vernacular web” is significant because it positions early digital culture as a kind of folk art, something that is based not on professional polish or commercial logic but on cultural expression, accessibility, and shared experimentation. Like vernacular architecture or oral storytelling traditions, this web was deeply situated: it reflected the material limitations, creative instincts, and lived experiences of its creators. Elements like GIF backgrounds, blinking text, clashing fonts, or broken links were not seen as failures but as features and traces of process and personality.
The decline of the vernacular web did not occur immediately. It unfolded alongside broader shifts in the design of digital systems themselves. As web spaces became more centralised and commercially managed, the underlying technologies that enabled user participation were also being reshaped, often in ways that distanced people from the inner workings of their tools. The shift wasn’t only cultural but also technical, gradually replacing visibility and control with smoothness, abstraction, and automation.

          Invisible Computing: How Tech Became Unapproachable 

This shift in user experience is best understood through the lens of invisible computing, a design philosophy that increasingly removes the user’s awareness of how systems function. The alienation of users from technology didn’thappen all at once. In early computing, engagement with machines was physical and direct. Programming demanded a close relationship with hardware, which Norton (2019) describes as being “close to the metal.” Users had to understand their tools to make them work, creating a sense of presence and agency.
This changed dramatically with Douglas Engelbart’s invention of the computer mouse in 1968 as part of his visionary“oN-Line System” (NLS). The mouse created a new kind of intimacy with machines, transforming the computer into an extension of the user’s body. Yet, paradoxically, this innovation also marked the beginning of a gradual distancing: as interactions became smoother and more abstract, the inner workings of technology became increasingly hidden (Real Life, 2020).
This abstraction became a design goal. This concept of “invisible computing” was championed by Don Norman, who, in his influential essay Why Interfaces Don’t Work (1990), proposed that “The real problem with the interface is that it is an interface. The computer of the future should be invisible!”. The tech industry quickly adopted this principle. Apple, for example, declared in a 2012 campaign, “Technology is best when invisible.” While this promise of seamlessness might seem elegant, it also detaches users from the systems they rely on, making questioning and understanding almost impossible. As Brenda Laurel famously remarked, computers became “doors without doorknobs” perfectly smooth, yet fundamentally inaccessible (Laurel, cited in Lialina, 2015).
Olia Lialina identifies this as a core reason for the transition from interface design to what is now called experience design. The aim is not simply to make technology easy to use but to erase awareness of technology altogether, leaving only the user’s emotions, goals, and tasks. The price of this comfort, however, is a deep alienation: users become not just operators but invisible presences within systems they can no longer interrogate or change. 
But what happens when we no longer see or understand the tools that shape our work and daily life patterns?

                The Current Digital Landscape: From Open Possibility to Constrained Control

We can see the consequences of this abstraction clearly in the current digital landscape. Technology, once promising and participatory, now feels remote and controlling. The contemporary internet is defined by what Powers (2011) calls digital maximalism, an environment engineered for relentless consumption rather than creative exploration. Hito Steyerl (2013) describes the modern web as “sanitised, surveilled, and monopolized” policed by corporations for the purposes of copyright, conformity, and profit. Chayka (2014) expands on this, suggesting that platforms now encourage users to act as curators, but only within pre-filtered, limited options. Algorithms govern our feeds, shaping experience and taste, quietly relegating users to the role of spectators. The promise of the agency is often an illusion; the choice is a performance enacted within tightly drawn boundaries.
The current landscape of monopolistic platforms, persistent surveillance, and the widespread manufacture of disinformation produces a form of digital exhaustion. The simple act of “being online” is less joyful and less present. Tolentino (2019) highlights how the internet has distorted our sense of identity, inflated the importance of personal opinions, and ultimately disrupted our understanding of scale and relevance. In this way, what was once a space of possibility has become, for many, a source of confusion, anxiety, and fatigue. And perhaps more importantly, it leaves little room for reflection or questioning. Instead of using technology, we’re moved through it passively, predictably.
The more I reflected on this, the more I began to see parallels within the discipline of Graphic Communication Design hasnot escaped these pressures and, in fact, is often defined by them in our capitalistic society. Unquestioned industry standard like software Adobe carries its presumptions of what design should look like and how it’s supposed to function.Behind their sleek interfaces lie systems that reward speed, uniformity, and invisibility.

            Section 2. From Observation to Framework: The Turn Toward Softer Computing
            
These insights began to clarify the historical foundation of the current structure of digital systems and their effect on the graphic design industry, which has become shaped by similar forces of automation, standardisation and illusive opacity.  The more I looked, the more I saw how to design software, workflows, and even aesthetic norms had internalised the logic of digital maximalism. The expectation to produce quickly, cleanly, and seamlessly leaves little space for critical reflection or creative subversion.
This recognition led me to seek a different framework that supports a more situated, relational, and open-ended approach to working. Rather than positioning technology as neutral or inevitable, I began to ask what it might mean to approach design with care, to value friction and slowness, and to remain attuned to the social and cultural systems they participate in.

         Why Now? A Context for Softer Computing 

For me, the very idea of “softer” computing comes from reflecting on the language of technology itself. “Hardware” describes the physical machinery - rigid, unyielding, and resistant to change. “Software,” by contrast, promises malleability. It is “soft” because it is supposed to be easy to change, update, and adapt. Yet this is a misleading comfort. In practice, contemporary software has become so complex, so deeply layered with proprietary code and abstracted interfaces, that even developers find it difficult to intervene. Far from soft, today’s software is often rigid, inaccessible, and resistant to meaningful modification.
This perspective resonated with my own experiences and helped me articulate what I was already sensing in my creative practice: a need for a softer, slower, and more situated approach.
Defining Softer Computing: Values and Orientation
Softer computing is a critical, reflective approach to technology emphasizing care, transparency, friction, and agency. It challenges the mainstream industry's focus on frictionless automation, hyper-efficiency, and commodification. As Mindy Seu (2022) suggests, softer computing confronts the passive acceptance of defaults dictated by powerful tech corporations and instead advocates active participation in shaping technology.
This framework is neither anti-technology nor purely technical. It positions technology as a relational practice, emphasizing ongoing negotiation between maker, tool, and context. By creating intentional moments of friction, ambiguity, and reflection, softer computing reclaims user agency and fosters meaningful engagement rather than passive consumption.

         Adobe and Design Software Monopolies: Defaultism, Templates, and Industry Standardisation

Nowhere is the logic of digital maximalism more evident than in design software itself. Adobe’s dominance on the creative market exemplifies how default-driven tools shape not just aesthetics but the creative thinking itself. As Rob Giampietro has argued, “The computer has changed design, but it has also changed our process of thinking and making” (Giampietro, 2014). Adobe Creative Suite, with its intricate ecosystems of templates and automated features, shapes not only how we work but also how we think about what design is and could be.
The introduction of the Macintosh computer, for instance, coincided with the decline of the Swiss International Style and the rise of a more automatic, industrialised approach to graphic design. “Default systems are machines for design creation,” Giampietro writes, describing a shift toward design practices that align with capitalist values like speed, replication, and efficiency over craft, nuance, and critical engagement (Giampietro, 2014). This reflected broader cultural and economic transitions - away from design as craft, and toward design as scalable production.
Default settings are far from being neutral. They actively sculpt creative outcomes. They make design more accessible to the masses, but also risk flattening difference and dehumanising the creative process. The designer is gradually replaced by the software, what once required intentional choice and authorship is now accomplished through the path of least resistance, the click of a button. Even the notion of “ugly design,” as Giampietro discusses, is bound up with these same systems, driven by a mix of democratic impulse and algorithmic convenience.
For me, this resonates with Olia Lialina’s critique of Adobe’s marketing: campaigns that claim, “I have more time to do what I like most - being creative,” while actually encouraging designers to distance themselves from code, links, and the deeper workings of the web. The message is clear: the less you understand about the technology, the more creative you supposedly are (Lialina, 2015). Software promises creative freedom while erasing the need to understand what happens inside.
Adobe not only standardises design processes but also acts as a gatekeeper for professional legitimacy. The more concerning issue is that default systems are designed to be invisible. Their norms, once established, become silent truths - rarely questioned, yet powerfully shaping the direction of an entire industry. As Pipkin (2019) observes, “To live a life within human society is to live a life inside of technologies, including many that have become so standardised and widespread that they are the default lens through which we view the world.” From a softer computing perspective, these defaults are not just technical, they are political, cultural, and epistemological. They are precisely what we must learn to see, question, and eventually reconfigure.

        Technology as Cultural Practice

This section explores how softer computing reframes technology as a cultural, ethical, and relational practice. Drawing from speculative theory and design philosophy, I investigate how values like friction, limitation, and care challenge dominant paradigms of growth, seamlessness, and automation.

1. Technology as Cultural Vessel
Ursula K. Le Guin’s Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction (1986) reimagines technology not as an instrument of conquest and domination but as a “cultural vessel” - a container for stories, relationships, and possibilities. For me, the cultural vessel becomes a metaphor for alternative design practice, as a methodology. Tools can hold complexity, contradiction, and collectivity, rather than enforce simplification or speed.

2. Friction as Design Ethic
Luna Maurer (2018) extends this argument into the digital realm, she calls for “friction” in design, arguing that meaningful connection emerges from encountering, rather than erasing, obstacles. Maurer observes that “transactions with machines are now smoother than interactions with fellow humans,” a fact that reveals how seamlessness has become a form of social alienation. This way friction, then, becomes not merely an inconvenience, it is a necessary condition for agency, awareness, and connection. Philosopher Miriam Rasch (2020) contends that the removal of friction produces passivity, leaving users “absorbing” technology rather than questioning or reshaping it. Maurer echoes this: “Friction perceived as an obstacle might, in fact, be a possibility for connection.” In this way, designing with and for friction means exploring the boundaries of our tools, inviting creative error and imperfection, and pushing against the uniformity imposed by platforms (2018).

3. Working Within Limits
This ethic of resistance aligns with the Computing within Limits research community (Tomlinson et al., 2015), which calls for computation that respects ecological and social boundaries. In these pricniples, constraint is not a flaw, but a foundation. Limits guide attention. They demand adaptation and situational thinking, values that have become central to my own practice.
For me, coding has become a form of writing, not because it tells a linear story, but because it reflects values through structure, rhythm, and form. As Spencer Chang (2024) suggests, programming is a way of thinking aloud. This reframing allows tool-making to become expressive, critical, and relational - a space where technical production and conceptual reflection merge. Working within limits opens space for localised, contextual, and deeply personal forms of design.

4. Reimagining Design Culture
Ursula Franklin’s insight (1999) that “technology is a system… a mindset” remains foundational here. The mindset dominant in today’s tech industry privileges automation, control, and standardisation. Softer computing refuses that logic. It embraces modularity, ambiguity, and partial knowledge. It values tools not for what they do efficiently, but for what they make possible - including failure, detour, and re-use.
This isn’t a rejection of design systems but a reorientation. It asks: Who are these systems for? What values do they carry? And what other forms of making - slower, smaller, less polished might better reflect the lives and contexts of those using them? While many creative communities embrace DIY or open-source approaches, softer computing is distinct in its embrace of imperfection, smallness, and slowness. It resists the logic that everything must scale, be universally accessible, or be optimised for productivity at all costs. However, this approach has limits: too much friction can hinder access, and too much smallness can isolate. Softer computing aims to balance these tensions by remaining open to re-evaluation and critique.

            Approaches: My Manifesto

A softer tool is not simply a device or piece of software but an approach to technology that is intentionally shaped by values of agency, reflection, and ethical interaction. Where traditional “hard” or prescriptive tools (Franklin, 1990) demand that users adapt themselves to rigid, invisible processes, a softer or holistic tool is designed for adaptability, transparency, and care. This kind of tool resists the prevailing drive for frictionless speed and efficiency, instead fostering a more mindful and participatory relationship between people and technology.
Ursula Franklin’s distinction between prescriptive and holistic technologies (1990) was an essential reference. Prescriptive systems are designed for repetition and uniformity, reducing the user’s role to that of operator. Holistic systems, by contrast, require the user’s presence, they demand engagement, improvisation, and situated knowledge. In this framework, design becomes less about compliance and more about authorship.


            The Values of Softer Tools

• Slowness: 
Softer tools allow for thoughtful engagement rather than the hurried, automated responses common in contemporary systems. Slowness here is not inefficiency, but an invitation to pause, reflect, and make choices that matter. The design encourages users to dwell in their process, to develop a sense of craft and understanding rather than simply to“get things done.” I intend to embrace in my design practice new methods of working, including new tools for making.
• Transparency: 
These tools make their inner workings visible. Users can see how their actions shape outcomes, building trust and supporting informed decisions. Transparency also means the design process is open to critique and modification, key for learning and empowerment.
• Friction: 
Far from being a flaw, friction is deliberately designed into softer tools as a way to prompt awareness and intention. By introducing small moments of resistance, these tools create space for questioning, experimentation, and creative divergence. As Luna Maurer has written, friction can become a “possibility for connection,”(n.d.) allowingtechnology to act as a site of dialogue rather than simple execution.
• Modularity: 
Softer tools are built to be understood, adapted, repaired, and extended in parts. This not only makes them more sustainable but supports resilience and ongoing learning, tools can be remade to suit changing needs, and users are empowered to intervene.
A softer tool, then, is more than the sum of its technical parts: it is an attitude toward design that foregrounds well-being, awareness, and autonomy. It reflects a commitment to users as agents and collaborators, rather than as passive operators.

            Section 3: From Framework to Practice – Designing Softer Tools

One of the most effective ways to resist the problems of today’s digital landscape and to challenge the direction technology is headed is simply to start making your tools, however small, amateur, or experimental. ‘For the tools will never dismantle the master's house’ (Laurde, 1984) – by taking ownership over the tools we create, we can be sure of inclusivity of technological futures, space built with our agency in mind. These acts of creation, even if they are strange or unfinished, contribute to a broader community of like-minded practitioners.
By learning how to code, or even just by slightly modifying existing tools, individuals gain the ability to understand, shape, and critically question the digital systems they rely on. This transformation from passive consumers to responsible creator is at the heart of softer computing. This helps in demystifying technology and invites others to overcome their fear of code, contributing to a culture where people are empowered rather than intimidated.
Important to note, softer approaches do not demand that every user become a programmer. Agency over technology is not contingent on formal coding skills. Often, people “misuse” or repurpose technology in ways that reflect their actual needs, desires, or cultural practices. This phenomenon which can be described as folk programming is the “(re)programming we learn through our active use of the Internet and software,” as Spencer Chang have described (JoinReboot, 2023). Folk programming emerges from the collective, everyday improvisations of users who “hack” or repurpose systems to solve problems, collaborate, or simply make technology their own.
All of this context frames my argument for tool-making as a radical act of resistance, and this is what I’m exploring in this project. “Softer computing” is not just a style or an aesthetic; it is a deliberate set of choices about scale, control, friction, and community. In the next paragraphs, in personal investigation I explore how the ways we build and adapt tools can become sites of creative defiance against high-tech, maximalist, and default-driven design culture.
My manifesto developed gradually, as a way to articulate the resistance I felt in practice. Its values friction, slowness, transparency, and care that emerged through repeated acts of design that refused default logic. I became less interested in creating streamlined outcomes and more invested in processes that demanded attention.

            Context of my tool: Typography as a case study

In resisting the passivity and sameness imposed by automated or prescriptive systems, the making of holistic technologies within digital practice becomes a radical gesture. It asks us to see technology not as something that happens to us, but as something that can be consciously shaped, questioned, and reimagined. Franklin’s holistic approach further invites us to consider technology as a set of social practices that are deeply embedded in questions of value, power, and collective agency. It encourages designers and technologists to critically interrogate not just what tools do, but whose interests they serve, and how they might be reclaimed as instruments of care, plurality, and liberation.

            Reimagining Typography: From Prescriptive Tool to Softer Practice

In this project, I approached tool-making as a way to identify and critically examine existing design canons, specifically within typography, and to reimagine their problematic aspects through a softer perspective. My aim was to question the structures that shape these tools, locate their “weak spots,” and rethink them as more open, more human, and moresituated systems.

I was especially drawn to typography because of its long and well-documented history, and the way it has been repeatedly theorised by designers across generations. Much of that history is rooted in the Western design canon, shaped by figures like Jan Tschichold, Max Miedinger, and Josef Müller-Brockmann, and grounded in dominant European and American ideals. These traditions are often framed around values of clarity, order, and control, particularly through the concept of legibility.

But legibility itself isn’t neutral. It has been historically constructed within a framework that prioritises a specific reading experience, shaped by ideas of “perfect” communication. This framework often aligns with systems of control, authority, and exclusion. As Paul Soulellis writes, “The idea of ‘perfect typography’ subscribes to a very particular power dynamic,involving knowledge, manipulation, and control.” Typography, in this sense, has always been political.

We can also understand this through the lens of Patricia Hill Collins’ matrix of domination, typographic systems are not just technical or aesthetic, but shaped by larger social structures like heteropatriarchy, white supremacy, capitalism, and colonialism. The history of type design reflects a process of cultural erasure, that can be seen through the dominance of Eurocentric standards that have often excluded or overwritten other ways of seeing and communicating. Johanna Drucker (1996) expands this idea, noting that typography doesn’t just convey meaning, it actively participates in shaping it. 
In dominant design culture, non-normative or non-conforming typographic gestures, when legibility is slowed down, obscured, or made ambiguous, are often viewed as disruptive or even threatening. These reactions expose how tightlytypography is tied to capitalism’s demand for productivity, clarity, and standardisation. Universal design principles, rooted in modernist ideologies, are treated as neutral, but they were never neutral to begin with. They were designed to optimise and control, not to question or expand.

            Manifesto as Creative Methodology: Applying Theory to Making

            a. Type Tool
Initially, my project emerged as a reflective response to traditional notions of legibility in typography, aiming to ground theoretical insights about our current technological state in tangible practice. Rather than adhering strictly to decades-old typographic conventions that prioritise meticulous detail and predictable results, I introduced a more interactive, human approach. Inspired by the idea of friction as bodily engagement, an aspect lost through the historical development of personal computing, I intentionally integrated non-normative, sometimes chaotic transformations into typographic forms. This approach challenged conventional legibility, deliberately creating unpredictable graphic patterns and questioning typography's traditional roles.
This exploration led to the development of a modular font that embodies values such as transparency and modularity. Its structure makes visible each transformation, clearly revealing the shaping of individual letterforms. During this process, I actively applied principles of softer computing by embedding acts of tool-making into my workflow, consciously aiming to lessen dependency on commercial software like Adobe Illustrator. Recognizing Illustrator’s limitations in handling modular designs efficiently, I experimented with Processing, creating a tool featuring a dynamic grid system for drawing and erasing modular circles. This allowed easy style experimentation, streamlined workflow, and ensured design cohesion.
To further embody the project’s participatory and open-source ethos, I created an interactive website that invites collective experimentation and encourages others to reinterpret and adapt my code for their own purposes. Users could interact with font transformations either by manipulating sliders and mouse movements or by physically engaging through camera interactions, pinching fingers to directly distort the letterforms.
           
            b. Publication as Communication
The publication arose from the necessity to communicate the critical discourse of softer computing to a broader audience clearly and accessibly. Through conversations and interviews with fellow designers, it became evident that many share frustration toward the dominance of commercialized, default-driven design software. This publication explicitly targets graphic designers, educators, critical technologists, and digital artists who seek alternatives and wish to critically engage with design infrastructure.
Acknowledging the importance of visual communication to my audience, I ensured that the graphic elements in the publication were generated predominantly through alternative and custom-built tools, including those developed in Processing. These tools facilitated the creation of modular grids for typography, pixelation effects, and image distortions. Additionally, I experimented with repurposing non-design software, such as Excel, to create graphics aligned with my vision of repurposing technology to fit user-specific needs.
Responding to feedback, I conceptualised the publication in both digital and physical formats. The digital platform, inspired by the Reading Machines publishing platform, reimagines traditional relationships among reader, text, and author, utilising web-specific interactions such as swiping gestures. It also functions as a tool, allowing users to selectively compile and download individual chapters according to their interests, reinforcing the principles of adaptability and customization central to softer computing.
            
            c. Open-Source Resource List
To reinforce the collective and participatory spirit central to my project, I integrated an open-source resource list into the website. Recognising that softer computing can only flourish through collaboration and shared knowledge, I provided an open link on the Are.na platform. This allows the public to contribute resources, collectively populating the web with small-scale, radical tools that embody the principles and potential of softer computing.

            Conclusion

  Softer computing began as a response to frustration with tools that felt too slick, too fast, too predetermined. But what it has become, through practice, reflection, and experimentation, is a deeper invitation to reconsider how we relate totechnology altogether. This project is not about rejecting design or software, but about reclaiming the space to question them. It's about making room for tools that are not only functional, but also expressive, imperfect, and situated in real lives.
  Through designing my own typographic tool, building a publication platform, and curating a collective resource list, I discovered how creative autonomy can be cultivated by resisting the defaults we are often prompted to accept. I realisedhow much can be done when friction is welcomed, when slowness is honoured, and when modularity opens space for adaptation rather than constraint. These small and deliberate acts form a kind of resistance. Not the loud, spectacular kind, but a quiet, ongoing commitment to working differently.
  In a landscape dominated by seamless systems and polished interfaces, softer computing insists that there is value in the rough edges. It asks us not just to make things, but to make thoughtfully, to understand the conditions of our making, and to keep space open for others to join, reinterpret, and reshape the tools we pass on. The work is far from finished, but that’s the point. This isn’t a solution or a blueprint. It’s an opening. And in that, I find both urgency and hope.
